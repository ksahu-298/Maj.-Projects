Sage — AI Chatbot for Mental Health Support
Sage is an AI-powered mental health support chatbot designed to provide emotional assistance, stress management guidance, and supportive conversations in a safe and user-friendly way.
The goal of Sage is not to replace professional help, but to act as a first-level companion for users who need someone to talk to, reflect with, and feel supported.
